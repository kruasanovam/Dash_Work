What is Dash Work?
It's an interactive dashboard that provides an overview of the job market in Germany. 

The project is based on data collected from the Bundesagentur f√ºr Arbeit (German Federal Employment Agency) and can be filtered by geografical parameters (Districts and Cities, Bundeslaender) and job sectors (e.g. Tourism, IT, BAU, etc.) The dashboard also provides some statistics regarding top employers, company size, new jobs over time and top sectors.
